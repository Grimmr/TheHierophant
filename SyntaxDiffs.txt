To make a syntax that works without conflicts in an LR(1) parser generator some changes had to be made to the rules in the spec

1) string literals:
    we use "stringconst -> stringconst STRING_LIT" not "stringconst -> stringconst stringconst". we don't actually care which arbitrary action our parser generator would choose. But this way we know that string consts should be evaluated top down

2) left handed lists:
    In general rules of the form "list -> list DELIM element | element | element DELIM" cause Menhir to generate a parser that will never accept a multi element list. To preserve the syntax tree specified in the docs we move the optional DELIM after an element to an optional DELIM after a list (ie: all productions "_ -> a list b" cause an additional productions "_ -> a list DELIM b" to be added. this doesn't change the shape of the AST as DELIM doesn't have semantic content) 
    Cases:
        ConstantBindings, GlobalBindings
